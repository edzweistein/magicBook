1. Overview
   --------
   JSpiff is a Java API for reading and writing XSPF ("Spiff") 
   open XML playlists. Tired of Winamp M3U playlists? So are we!
   
	
2. Features
   --------
   -> It is open -- No proprietary lock-in.
   -> It is portable -- You should be able to send a playlist to your friend and have it work.
   -> It is well-engineered -- Most playlist formats get the easy things wrong.
   -> Unlike M3U -- XSPF is XML.
   -> Unlike SMIL -- XSPF is simple.
   -> Unlike ASX -- XSPF is open.
   -> JAXP Implementation available
   -> JAXB Implementation available
   -> Simple to use Java API

final XspfPlaylist playlist = new XspfPlaylist();
playlist.setTitle("Track Test Playlist");

playlist.setDate(new Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis()));
playlist.setInfo("http://melloware.com/");
playlist.setVersion("1");
playlist.setImage("http://melloware.com/images/header.jpg");
playlist.setIdentifier(Integer.toString(super.hashCode()));
playlist.setLicense("http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt");

// create track list first
final XspfPlaylistTrackList tracks = new XspfPlaylistTrackList();

// now create track 1 and add to list
XspfTrack track = new XspfTrack();
track.setIdentifier("135c3af5-526f-4d87-9757-1b404b51e31d");
track.setLocation("C:\\music\\01 - She Talks To Angels.mp3");
track.setCreator("Black Crowes");
track.setAlbum("Shake Your Moneymaker");
track.setTitle("She Talks To Angels");
track.setAnnotation("This is a classic song");
track.setTrackNumByString("01");

// now create track 2 and add to list
track = new XspfTrack();
track.setIdentifier("e113c56f-c4d4-4bfb-b9f0-6f90a172b5a9");

5. Acknowledgements
   ----------------
   JSpiff could not be possible without Xiph.org creating the XSPF 
   playlist format.  We would like to thank them for putting this
   forward and getting the entire music community away from proprietary
   playlist formats.
